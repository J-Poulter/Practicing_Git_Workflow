Taking a cruise is my only experience with traveling outside the country but it was very enjoyable.  I got to experience what it was like to be in different countries as the boat stopped by a handful of different islands.  In the future, I would love to travel to Vietnam as that is where my mother is from, and then I would like to explore the different countries in Europe.
